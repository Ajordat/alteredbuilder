    <h5>Discussions</h5>
    <p>Most of the discussions regarding this (and other Altered-related programming stuff) happen in this <i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/hQKb2ENZ" target="_blank">Altered Programming <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a></p>
    <p>This server has proved to be a very good source of suggestions, bug reports and feature requests. Without this subcommunity of Altered enjoyers this site wouldn't be half as good as it is.</p>
