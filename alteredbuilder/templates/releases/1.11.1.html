<p>This new release provides a way to tag your decks!</p>
<p>
    Tag your decks with one of the following playstyles:
    <span class="badge bg-primary">Aggro</span>, <span class="badge bg-primary">Midrange</span> or <span class="badge bg-primary">Control</span><br>    
    And to further expand its categorization, add up to two of these tags:
    <span class="badge bg-secondary">Combo</span>, <span class="badge bg-secondary">Disruption</span>, <span class="badge bg-secondary">Ramp</span> and <span class="badge bg-secondary">Token</span><br>
    It is also possible to search for decks using these tags, so make sure to categorize your creations so they are easily found!

            <li>As you know, the awesome website "<a href="https://exalts-table.com/" target="_blank">Exalts Table</a>" provides the playtest functionality to this site; however, Pioupiou has been asked to temporarily disable the virtual table until the 13th of September (in {{ release_date|timeuntil }}), when the game officially releases. Apologies for the inconvenience!</li>
